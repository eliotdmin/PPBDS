# Only the book-builders manipulate this file. It needs to be left with both 
# html:[] files lists commented out. This makes it easy for chapter writers to just
# knit their chapters eaasily. For book-builder convenience, we keep two of these
# html:[] lists around. The short one is just for us testing out the set up. 
# The long one is the full book. Uncomment the one you want when building the book, 
# by hitting "Build Website".

# Here are some more detailed comments on the individual entries:

# book_filename: sets the filename of the main Rmd file. Maybe a shorter name would be more convenients?

# language: Allows for customization of the default titles. Eg: change fig to FIGURE

# delete_merged_file: deletes main Rmd file after book is sucessful rendered

# output_dir: sets the output diretory of the book

# rmd_files: allows to set custom order of Rmd files for the book. 
# Note that the "html:" must be indented with a tab, not with spaces. 

# These two problems are what caused (some of) the appendices to appear as chapters.
# Must use tabs (not spaces!) in this file, at least when indenting "html: [ ..."
# Also, if there are no "html: [" entries, it will just build every Rmd in the directory.
# Also, # (APPENDIX) Appendix {-} header is what starts the appendix.
