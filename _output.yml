msmbstyle::msmb_html_book:
  css: style.css
  toc: TRUE
  toc_depth: 1
  split_by: chapter

# Make sure you have **msmbstyle** package installed with 
# remotes::install_github("grimbough/msmbstyle")

# We are still working through our understanding of our css style file, which
# we have started to hack. See it for comments. We are also somewhat confused by
# the interaction between our style.css file and whatever magic the msmbstyle
# package is doing.

# toc: true gives us a Table of Contents, which we want.

# toc_depth: we want the table of contents to just have one level of depth. So, when
# you are at the cover of the book, you just see chapters. But when you are on chapter
# page, you see the subsections, as specified by `##`.

# split_by: needs to be `chapter`, for reasons which are unclear to us.
