msmbstyle::msmb_html_book:
  css: style.css
  toc: TRUE
  toc_depth: 1
  split_by: chapter


# Make sure you have **msmbstyle** package installed with 
# remotes::install_github("grimbough/msmbstyle")

# toc: true gives us a TOC

# toc_depth: we want the table of contents to just have one level of depth. So, when
# you are at the cover of the book, you just see chapters. But when you are on chapter
# page, you see the subsections, as specified by `##`.

# split_by: needs to be `chapter`, for reasons which are unclear to us.
